## How to play

`
This is a game with a goal to get the most score by finish the
enemies. Figure 1 shows the menu screen which you can choose start option,
high score option, help option or quitting the game.

There are 3 keys that you can use when the game is running. The
first is “spacebar” for pipe jumping. The second is “R key” for using bomb
skill. The last is “enter” for pause the game. If you eliminate the
enemies you will get 1 score point. There are 2 kinds of enemies (normal bird
and bomber bird). The normal birds could be finished by hitting the pipe. If
normal birds fly through the pipe, you will lose a life point. The bomber birds
could be finished by letting them through the pipe. If bomber birds hit the
pipe, you will lose a life point.
Every time you lose a life point, the pipe will be flinching for 2
seconds and it can’t take any damage when it is flinching.
